Questions 1 :- to check given number is EVEN or ODD.
algorithm
START
step1 ; write the number N
step2 ; divide the number by 2 (N/20
step3 ; if number is completely divide by 2 then it is EVEN
step4 ; if reminder is 1 then number is ODD  
END

Question 2 :- Write a Java Program to find the Factorial of given number
START
Step1 :- write the the number (N)
Step2 ;- initialize the for loop
step3 ;- multiple the number from i=1 to i=N
step4 ;- after geting i=N, print the result
step5 ;- factorial of given number is "result"
END

Question4;- Swap two numbers without using third variable approach
START
step1 ;- take input number from user 
step2 ;- using string args identifity the index of each number(args[0]....)
step3 ;- write the string in reverse order (args[last]....args [0])
step4 ;- print the result in the resultant string
END

Question5;- How to check the given number is Positive or Negative in Java? 
START
step1 ;- take input from user
step2 ;- use the if else condition 
step3 ;- if the number is greater thean zero, print 'positive number'
step4;- else print 'negative number'
END


Question6;-Write a Java Program to find whether given number is Leap year or NOT? 
START
step1 ;- take input year from user
step2 ;- now divide number by 4 ; if year/4=0 then check step 4 skip step 3
step3 ;- now divide the number by 400; if year/400=0 check step 4
step4 ;- now divide the year by 100; year/100=!0 then 'print leap year'
step5 ;- if step 2/3 are correct and step4 is not correct then print 'this not leap year'
END

Question 7;- Write a Java Program to Print 1 To 10 Without Using Loop
START
step1 ;- take the input number from user 
step2 ;- multiple the number by 1, print the result
step3 ;- multiple the number by 2, print the result
step4 ;- multiple the number by 3, print the result
step5 ;- multiple the number by 4, print the result
step6 ;- multiple the number by 5, print the result
step7 ;- multiple the number by 6, print the result
step8 ;- multiple the number by 7, print the result
step9 ;- multiple the number by 8, print the result
step10 ;- multiple the number by 9, print the result
step11 ;- multiple the number by 10, print the result
END

Question8 ;-Write a Java Program to print the digits of a Given Number
START
step1 ;- take the number form user
step2 ;- using string function print args[0]
step3 ;- using string function print args[1]
step4 ;- using string function print args[2]
step5 ;- using string function print args[3]
step6 ;- using string function print args[4]

Question9 ;-Write a Java Program to print all the Factors of the Given number.
START
step1 ;- take number from user
step2 ;- initiate prime number in the class,
step3 :- now divide the number by prime 
step4 ;- repeat the procedure until last number is prime or one
step5 ;- print all the prime number by whcich we divide
END

Question10;-0. Write a Java Program to find sum of the digits of a given number. 
START
step1 ;- take input number from user 
step2 ;- in string array will save each digit from each number 
step3 ;- it will store form args[0] to args[n], where n= number of digit in number
step4 ;- now in any int variable will add those digit seperately
step5 ;- print the sum 
END

Question11 ;-Write a Java Program to find the smallest of 3 numbers (a,b,c) 
START
step1 ;- take three number from user a,b,c
step2 ;- initiate the if loop
step3 ;- check a<b & a<c then print a is smallest number 
step4 ;- check b<a & b<c then print b is smallest number 
step5 ;- check c<a & c<b then print c is smallest number
END

Question12 ;-. How to add two numbers with using the arithmetic operators in Java.
START
step1 ;- take input two numbers from user
step2 ;- save it in two 'int' variable n1, n2 
step3 ;- take int variable n3 , 
step4 ;- take sum of two numbers n1,n2
step5 ;- print the the resultant number n3
END

Question 14 ;-Write a Java Program to find GCD of two given numbers.  
START
step1 ;- take the input from user 
step2 ;- now divide the numbers by prime number 
step3 ;- if both the numbers are diveded by number then note it 
step3 ;- repeat procedure till last number 
step4 ;- take procdyct of such numbers
step5 ;- print 'GDC' of the number as product
END

Question 19 ;- To print the following series EVEN number Series 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 ..... 
START
step1 ;- initialize for loop
step2 ;- initialize with i=o;
step3 ;- give the termination / limiting value of i
step4 ;- use modification as i++ i.e. post incremental
step5 ;- print the Even number , if number is divisible by two
END

Question20 ;- To print the following series ODD number Series 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 ....
START
step1 ;- initialize for loop
step2 ;- initialize with i=o;
step3 ;- give the termination / limiting value of i
step4 ;- use modification as i++ i.e. post incremental
step5 ;- print the ODD number , if number is not divisible by two
